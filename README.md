Using hard-coded values for state transitions and state names (for simplicity).

Looking to have a system where I can calculate the probability of a particular state change in 'n' steps.

I will likely write a smaller version first that works for 2x2 transition matrices, and then move to automation after understanding the mathematics more as I reach completion.
